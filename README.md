# 🚀 90 Days Prep for Career Switch

Inspired by [Akshay Saini's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshaymarch7/) recent video, I’ve committed the next **90 days** to intensely prepare for switching companies and leveling up my software engineering skills.

This repo will serve as a daily tracker and documentation of my journey.

## 🎯 Goals

- ✅ **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** – 3 hours daily
- ✅ **React + Real-World Projects** – Hands-on frontend work (3 hours dailt)
- ✅ **Operating Systems, DBMS, and CN** – Any One (1 hour daily)

## 📌 Why I'm Doing This

> “Discipline beats motivation.”  
> Consistency compounds over time. I’m building habits that will not only help me switch to a better role but make me a better engineer overall.
